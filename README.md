# Film Label Prediction and College GPA Data Analysis 

## A. Film Label Prediction (Logistic Regression)

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Film Label Prediction Project! This project aims to leverage logistic regression to predict whether a film will be labeled as “Good” or “Bad” based on various predictors such as Description, Time (Duration), Cast, and Rating. By analyzing these factors, we seek to uncover valuable insights into what contributes to a film’s success or failure.

## 2. Business Questions
Several key business questions drive our analysis:

Description Analysis: How do the length and content of a film’s description influence its likelihood of being labeled as “Good”?

Time (Duration): Is there an optimal film duration that maximizes the chances of a film being labeled as “Good”?

Cast Influence: Does the presence of certain actors or directors significantly affect the film’s label?

Rating Impact: What rating thresholds indicate a higher probability of a film being labeled as “Good”?

Combined Predictors: How do interactions between description, time, cast, and rating collectively influence the film’s label?

Market Segmentation: Are there specific genres or market segments where these predictors have a stronger influence?


## 3. The primary objectives of this project are:

To build a logistic regression model that accurately predicts the label of a film.

To identify and analyze the key factors that contribute to a film being labeled as “Good” or “Bad”.

To provide actionable insights for filmmakers, producers, and marketers to enhance film quality and marketability.

## 4.Data and Methodology
We will use a dataset containing information on various films, including their descriptions, durations, cast details, and ratings. The logistic regression model will be trained and tested on this data to evaluate its predictive performance. Additionally, we will explore the relationships between different predictors and the film labels to gain deeper insights.



## B. College GPA Prediction Project (Linear Regression)

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the College GPA Prediction Project! This project aims to utilize linear regression to predict college GPA based on predictors such as High School GPA and SAT Scores. Additionally, we will conduct hypothesis testing and a two-sample t-test to explore differences in college GPA between first-generation (FirstGen) and non-first-generation students.

## 2. Business Questions

Several key business questions drive our analysis:

Predictive Analysis: How accurately can we predict a student’s college GPA based on their high school GPA and SAT scores?

FirstGen Impact: Are there significant differences in college GPA between first-generation and non-first-generation students?

Hypothesis Testing: What are the results of hypothesis testing regarding the predictors’ influence on college GPA?

Two-Sample T-Test: Does the two-sample t-test reveal any significant differences in the means of college GPA between first-generation and non-first-generation students?
Objectives

## 3. The primary objectives of this project are:
To build a linear regression model that accurately predicts college GPA.

To identify and analyze the key factors that influence college GPA.

To conduct hypothesis testing to validate the significance of our predictors.

A two-sample t-test will be performed to determine if there are significant differences in college GPA between first-generation and non-first-generation students.

## 4. Data and Methodology
We will use a dataset containing information on students’ high school GPAs, SAT scores, and college GPAs. The dataset also includes a “FirstGen” column indicating whether a student is a first-generation college student. Our methodology includes:

Building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict college GPA.
Conducting hypothesis testing to assess the significance of high school GPA and SAT scores as predictors.
Performing a two-sample t-test to compare the means of college GPA between first-generation and non-first-generation students.
